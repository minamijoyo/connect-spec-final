    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines how an OpenID Authentication 2.0 relying
      party can migrate the user from OpenID 2.0 identifier to OpenID Connect
      Identifier by using an ID Token that includes the OpenID 2.0 verified
      claimed ID. In this specification, the method to request such an
      additional claim and the method for the verification of the resulting ID
      Token is specified.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>OpenID Authentication 2.0 is a popular authentication federation
      protocol through which the relying party can obtain the user&rsquo;s
      verified identifier from the OpenID Provider (OP) to which the user was
      authenticated. OpenID Connect is a new version of OpenID Authentication but the
      identifier format is different and thus relying parties need to migrate
      those user identifiers to continue serving these users.</t>

      <t>In this specification, a standard method for this kind of migration
      on a per-user basis is described.</t>

             title="Requesting the OpenID 2.0 Identifier and OpenID Connect Identifier Together">
      <t>To obtain the OpenID 2.0 Identifier, the RP sends a modified OpenID
      Connect Authentication Request by adding <spanx style="verb">openid2</spanx>
      as an additional scope value.</t>

      <t>If PPID was used to obtain the OpenID 2.0 Identifier, 
      <spanx style="verb">openid.realm</spanx>
      has to be sent to the OP with the request. For this purpose, a new
      authentication request parameter <spanx style="verb">openid2_realm</spanx>
      is defined.</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="openid2_realm"><vspace />OPTIONAL. The <spanx

        </list>If the authority section of Authorization Endpoint URI is
      different from the authority section of the OpenID 2.0 OP&rsquo;s OP
      Endpoint URL, the client MUST issue a GET request to the OpenID 2.0
      Identifier obtained through the ID Token, i.e., the value of
      <spanx style="verb">openid2_id</spanx>, with
      an Accept header set to <spanx style="verb">application/json</spanx>
      to obtain the value of

      The value of the <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> claim 
      obtained this way and the value of 
      the <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> 
      claim in the ID Token MUST exactly match.
      </t>

      <t>NOTE: This is similar to <xref target="Yadis">Yadis</xref>.
      In the Yadis case, it is using an Accept header with
      its value set to <spanx style="verb">application/xml+xrds.</spanx></t>

      <t>NOTE: If the value of <spanx style="verb">openid2_id</spanx> is a
      <xref target="XRI_Syntax_2.0">XRI</xref>, the mechanism for verifying the
      <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> in the ID Token is still TBD.
      This may involve work by xri.net or individual i-Brokers.</t>

    <section anchor="GoogleDifference" title="Differences from Google&rsquo;s Migration Guide as of June 3, 2014 ">
      <t>In this appendix, the differences between this spec and
      Google&rsquo;s migration guide as of June 3, 2014 are explained. The
      differences are categorized in accordance with the section number of
      this specification. Google's migration guide is available at <eref 
      target="https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OpenID#openid-connect">
      Migrating to OAuth 2.0 login (OpenID Connect)
      </eref>.
      </t>

      <t><xref target="RequestOpenid2Id" format="counter" />. 
      <xref target="RequestOpenid2Id" format="title" /></t>

      <t>Google uses <spanx style="verb">openid.realm</spanx> instead. Since
      OpenID Connect uses param_name style instead of <spanx style="verb">param.name</spanx>,
      as well as the name <spanx style="verb">openid.realm</spanx> may mislead
      the user that it is a Connect parameter proper, it has been changed to
      <spanx style="verb">openid2_realm</spanx>.</t>

      <t>Google uses the existence of 
      <spanx style="verb">openid.realm</spanx> parameter to switch the
      behavior at the Connect OP. New scope value <spanx style="verb">openid2</spanx>
      has been introduced in this spec to make it more explicit and
      semantically in-line that it is asking for a resource.</t>

      <t><xref target="VerifyRP" format="counter" />. 
      <xref target="VerifyRP" format="title" /></t>

      <t>Google does not perform RP verification.</t>

      <t><xref target="ReturnOpenID2ID" format="counter" />. 
      <xref target="ReturnOpenID2ID" format="title" /></t>

      <t>Google uses the claim name <spanx style="verb">openid_id</spanx> instead of <spanx
      style="verb">openid2_id</spanx> . It was changed to <spanx style="verb">openid2_id</spanx>
      because <spanx style="verb">openid_id</spanx> may cause confusion among
      people that it is the Connect identifier. Since this spec allows
      providing <spanx style="verb">openid2_id</spanx> even after the OpenID
      2.0 OP has been taken down, this claim may persists much longer than the
      OpenID 2.0 OP. Thus, the chance of confusion should be minimized. </t>

      <t>Google does not take care of <xref target="XRI_Syntax_2.0">XRI</xref>
      while this standard does.</t>

      <t><xref target="VerifyOPAuthority" format="counter" />. 
      <xref target="VerifyOPAuthority" format="title" /></t>

      <t>Google does not perform authority verification.</t>
